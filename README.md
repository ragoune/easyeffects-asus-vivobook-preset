# Asus Vivobook 16X OLED Easy Effects preset

This is a preset for [Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) to improve the default audio on Linux.
The tested model is an Asus laptop Vivobook 16X OLED, integrating Harman / Kardon audio system.

The preset is based on the guide [_Enhancing your internal notebook speakers without using an Equalizer_ by Markus Schmidt](https://wwmm.github.io/easyeffects/guide_1.html).
Guidelines for the effects are available here https://wwmm.github.io/easyeffects/

There is some differences with the tutorial, outside of the values for the effects:

- Huge gain on the third band (1250-5000 Hz), to get more clarity on human voices
- Loudness effects to add more volume and bass
- Instead of using a Limiter, I use a Maximizer to adjust even more the loudness of the audio while keeping the output lower to 0.0dB

With this setting we should get the most of Loudness & Bass from the speakers, while staying away from saturation.
